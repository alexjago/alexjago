### Hi, I'm Alex.

I've recently graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of Queensland, majoring in Cyber Security, having previously studied towards an Electrical & Computer Engineering degree, also at UQ.

I take pride in ensuring that information is correct, complete and comprehensible, both as an inherent virtue and to empower everyone to make good decisions.
